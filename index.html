                <p>Apples&Oranges is a community-driven price comparison tool for Australian healthcare - the first of it’s kind. We rely on our users to l et us know what they pay for healthcare at different providers across the country, and then we make this information available to everyone.</p>
                <p>Use the search function to access the Apples&Oranges App and find out if you are overpaying for healthcare.</p>

            <div class="headertext"> The why
                <p> Everyone knows that apples and oranges can’t be compared, but healthcare should be different. Our mission is to provide Australians with the knowledge and data they need to make informed decisions about personal healthcare spending. </p>
                <p>  When it comes to our health, the cost of products and services is deliberately obscured to keep consumers in the dark. Whether it’s your out-of-pocket expense for a general dental check-up and clean, or the cost of elective surgery, it is impossible to know if you are paying a fair price for your treatment. Specialist consultations are expensive, which makes it even harder to compare the options. </p>
                <p>We built Apples&Oranges so that Australians can break the status quo and help each other be better informed about the cost of healthcare services. </p>
